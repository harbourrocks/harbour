# How can I help with harbour

## Tl;dr
Its a student project currently out for grading :(

## Why?
At first let me tell you that we are increadibly happy that you want to contribute to harbour.rocks! It is a great honor for us to have you with us!

### However...
...harbour.rocks is a student project of 4 students at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg.
harbour is developed for our lecture Websystems and will be graded at the end of the semester (07/20).
Therefore we can not accept any contributions to this project even if it is great stuff you have to deliver.
However we appreciate any kind of contributions after semester ending starting at 08/20, it would be such a great honor to have many people working on this project and we are really looking forward to those times!
We hope you understand this restriction and will still continue to reach out to us and this repository to get notifications about the latest developments.
We are also happy about any sharing, posting, tweeting, staring, promoting since we belive there is a great potential in harbour to deliver a first class on-premis and cloud based graphical docker registry.
